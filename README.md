# VaronFi for PlayStation 2

This is the official repository for the VaronFi service for PlayStation 2 (PS2). 

VaronFi for PS2 aims to emulate the DNAS servers based on FogNo23's "DNAS forever" project and in future, to emulate GameSpy so that dozens of PS2 titles can be played online via the VaronFi DNS; the same DNS as the Nintendo Wii servers for VaronFi. 

Since VaronFi currently only emulates DNAS, the only supported title right now is Call of Duty 3. However, we have a list of *over 50 games* below that should be supported once we implement our GameSpy emulator.
